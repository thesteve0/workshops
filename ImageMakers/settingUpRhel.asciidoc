== Setting up your RHEL base VM

While being primed is great, there is also even more value in getting to a certified container.
Red Hat now provides Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) for free for development purposes. The
steps to getting the VM setup are:

1. Register at http://developer.redhat.com
2. Download the RHEL ISO from https://developers.redhat.com/downloads/
3. Take your favorite VM technology and make a RHEL VM (I used VirtualBox)
4. Log in as root and do the following commands:

[source, bash]
-----
$ subscription-manager register # use your username and password from above
$ subscription-manager attach # should just work
$ yum update
$ reboot
$ subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-7-server-extras-rpms
$ subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-7-server-optional-rpms
# Do all the steps neccessary to install the guest additions on VirtualBox
# Useful for when we try to build our docker image
-----

==== Installing Docker
Right now there are two version of Docker you can install into RHEL.
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-enterprise-linux-atomic-host/7/single/getting-started-with-containers/#getting_docker_in_rhel_7

Until OpenShift 3.3 comes out please use 1.9:

[source, bash]
----

$ yum install docker --exclude docker-1.10* --exclude docker-selinux-1.10*

----

==== Add registry.access.redhat.com to the Docker Client

==== Summary

Now you have a machine that is ready to build Docker images based on RHEL. Any Docker image you build on this
box will get it's enablement from the underlying host OS. So now you can start your Dockerfile with:

[source, bash]
-----
FROM rhel:7.2
-----

and it should just work.  Here is an example of a Docker build file that should work for you - https://github.com/sclorg/rhscl-dockerfiles/blob/master/rhel7.s2i-base/Dockerfile

These instructions are for a very minimal RHEL install. You will probably find that you need other tools installed on the
machine as well. Go ahead and add any other tools you want. Don't forget about https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL[EPEL]
for packages not found in the standard repos.
